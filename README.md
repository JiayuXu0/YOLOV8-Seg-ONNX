# YOLOV8-Seg-ONNX
This project is a demo of instance segmentation using Yolov8 and ONNX Runtime. It is written in C++ and utilizes the OpenCV library for image processing. With this demo, you can learn how to load a model, perform image preprocessing, run inference, post-process the results, and generate instance segmentation images.
